                <p>
                    Windows Phone was a mobile operating System. Developed by Microsoft. 
                    First released in 2015, it is a successor to Windows Phone 8.1, but was 
                    marketed by Microsoft as being an edition of its PC operating system Windows 10.
                    Windows 10 Mobile aimed to provide greater consistency with its counterpart 
                    for PCs, including more extensive synchronization of content, Universal Windows 
                    Platform apps, as well as the capability, on supported hardware, to connect devices 
                    to an external display and use a desktop interface with mouse and keyboard input 
                    support (reminiscent of Windows on PCs). Microsoft built tools for developers to 
                    port iOS Objective-C apps with minimal modifications.
                    Windows Phone was discontinued in the year 2017. With Support ending in 2019.
