                <h2>What is an Operating System?</h2>
                <p>
                    An operating system manages the system's resources. 
                    It is the operating system that coordinates the amount of
                    memory used by each program. It controls how and when programs
                    can access hardware. It also tells software what hardware is
                    available. Additionally, the operating system

                <h2>Types of Operating Systems</h2>
                <p>
                    There are different types of operating systems. Many modern 
                    operating systems depend on a graphical user interface. However,
                    some operating systems can be run without a GUI. Some people
                    find that using a command shell is much more empowering. For
                    the rest of the world, however, the GUI makes it easier to 
                    communicate with the system. That is why the most popular
                    operating systems include Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. All three
                    have different GUI's and feel different.
